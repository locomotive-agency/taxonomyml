PROMPT_TEMPLATE_TAXONOMY = """
As an expert in taxonomy creation, we need your assistance in developing a clear, high-level website taxonomy based on a provided list of topics. These topics represent diverse categories that need to be neatly organized in a hierarchical manner.

Subject of website: {subject}

Important Topics:
{query_data}

The topics are a list of topic ngrams and their scores. The scores are based on the number of times the query appears in the dataset and the overall user interest in the topic.  Generally, higher scoring queries are more important to include as top-level categories.

Please adhere to the following dash-prefix format for your output. The taxonomy should be structured, as an example, as follows:
- Category
  - Subcategory
    - Sub-subcategory
  - Subcategory
- Category
  - Subcategory
    - Sub-subcategory
       - Sub-sub-subcategory  
    - Sub-subcategory

In order to effectively accomplish this task, you MUST follow the following guidelines:
 - Brands: The Important Topics may mention these specific brands `{brands}`. When creating your taxonomy, please omit these brand terms. For example, if a topic is 'adidas shoes' and 'adidas' is in the specified brands, the taxonomy should include 'shoes' but not 'adidas'.
 - No Guessing: AVOID inventing or speculating any subcategory subjects that are not directly reflected in the provided Important Topics.
 - Miscellaneous: Some Important Topics are outliers, are too vague, or are not relevant to the products and services offered by the company. Assign these topics to a top-level category called 'Miscellaneous' e.g. Miscellaneous > Dogs (where all topics are related to shoes).
 - Depth of Taxonomy: The taxonomy should be no more than four levels deep (i.e., Category > Subcategory > Sub-subcategory > Sub-sub-subcategory). 
 - Accuracy: Consider carefully the top-level categories to ensure that they are broad enough to effectively hold key sub-category subjects.
 - Readability: Ensure that category names are concise yet descriptive.
 - Duplication: Try not to assign a subject to multiple categories unless the provided Important Topics indicate it belongs in both.
 - Output: Only output the taxonomy.  DO NOT include commentary.

Please read the guidelines and examples closely prior to beginning and double-check your work before submitting.

PROMPT_TEMPLATE_TAXONOMY_REVIEW = """As a master of taxonomy creation, we need your assistance in developing a clear, high-level website taxonomy. Another member of the team has already created a taxonomy, but we need your help to review it and adjust it as needed.

Here is the taxonomy that was created:
{taxonomy}

Please review the taxonomy and make any necessary changes. If you believe that the taxonomy is correct, please submit it as is.

Follow the folliwng guidelines when reviewing this taxonomy:
 - Remove any Miscellaneous sub-categories that are already assigned to other categories. For example, if there is a category called 'Nike > Shoes > NEO Vulc' and another category called 'Miscellaneous > Neo Vulc', please remove the 'Miscellaneous > Neo Vulc' category.
 - Make sure all category designations are accurate and appropriate.
 - Ensure that categories are not duplicated. For example, if there is a category called 'Nike > Shoes > NEO Vulc' and another category called 'Nike > Shoes > NEO  > NEO Vulc', please remove the 'Nike > Shoes > NEO Vulc' category as this topic is already covered in a more granular category.
 - Review the category names for readability. Ensure that category names are concise yet descriptive.
 - Output: Only output the taxonomy.  DO NOT include commentary.


Keep the formatting of the original taxonomy. The taxonomy should be structured, as an example, as follows:
- Category
  - Subcategory
    - Sub-subcategory
  - Subcategory
- Category
  - Subcategory
    - Sub-subcategory
       - Sub-sub-subcategory  
    - Sub-subcategory

Please read the guidelines closely prior to beginning and double-check your work before submitting.
